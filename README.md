Lights, Camera, Location! is a webpage that can help users pinpoint where their favourite Hollywood movies were filmed. After inputting any movie title into the search engine, an interactive map is created with markers at each filming location across the globe! With each marker comes an InfoWindow which provides more information on that location. You can zoom in to any country, region, or city of your choice. Curious about what is near you at that moment? Just click "Filming Locations Near Me" and you will be able to take a closer look at what is in your area.
